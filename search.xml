      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Introduction Hello there! I don’t know how you find this blog, but hey, if you are applying postgraduate programs, 5 minutes is all you need to know everything about The ACE Method, which I am developing to aid those who is or will be struggling like me.The ACE stands for 3 simple words: Alumni, Condition and Engagement. And this is also just the 3 steps for you to take in order. Alumni. Don’t be surprised, think ahead is of vital importance for you. No matter which program you want to take, you’ll inevitably become a potential famous alumni. Especially for those porgrams which only last for 1 year or 2, they may expect very little from you in such a short time. However, you are earmarked with “John Doe’s School” forever. In this step, you need to have a relatively clear career plan. Then you should find those who fits your career goal on “Linkedin Like” websites, to see where are they come from and their “alumni property”. In this way, you’ll get a list of “Target Schools (Unfiltered)”. Condition. Looking at the spreadsheet you’ve just generated, you may find some schools are not reliable, such as a business school loacted in Pyongyang. Delete those you don’t like, according to whatever reasons you like, it’s your own application anyway. Leave no more than 15 schools on the “Target Schools (Filtered)” list. Then look into those schools after your selection, find the basic conditions for admission. Remember, you may achieve your career goal by taking a variety of independent programs, and they probably have different conditions, just make sure you’ve grasped every single opportunities! Obviously, next you need to compare your own condition with the requirements: GPA, internship experience, academic backgroud, iBT, IELTS etc..Attention! This is called CONDITION for a reason, because you may get a CONDITIONAL OFFER from any school, so don’t be upset when you find the requirements published are a little too high. You can be the next exception! Engagement.This is the easiest part, but can also be a little tricky if you are not determined. “1+2=3” is easy, but if I ask you to add from 1 to a certain number, which I won’t tell you, only with your bare hands is not something easy to do. It’s just like self-exploring, you can do one step easily and know better about yourself. However, you can still dig one-step deeper, not knowing the exact depth. When you start the draft of your PS, you need to show your engagement in the area, the school, even the whole industry. The thing is, you cannot discover your engagement unless you know yourself very well. It’s like buying some everyday goods or services for free, you must show your sponsor you are buying it for a reason, and you can maximize its utility. Thus, get yourself engaged in the program before your application and prepare a perfect to impress the admission officers! Thank you for staying with me, are you interested in this ACE method? This is acutally derived from my last post article Why I Am Qualified for Manchester?, and it’s merely a brief introduction, there will be a series of following updates which can provide much more detailed information about every step. And I might post some problems I met during my applicaitonand its solutions. This blog will be updated at least once a week, but I’ll check the comments every day. So leave your comments below or just email me at zhangjr@email.cufe.edu.cn (in case you may have limited access to Disqus). Looking forward to hearing from you lovely guys!]]></content>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[This self-proving process is painstaking (which means this will be updated occasionally). From my point of view, there are three reletively independent parts for a qualification, which in short is TEA. Ticket The first thing for me is to give the addmissions officers a strong reason to click open my CV and resume. The basic supporting material is the ticket to next step. GPA, IELTS or iBT, recommendation letters and a related academic background. After ticking the requirment spreadsheet, luckily, I think I’ve got it right. However, a ticket is not a guarantee. Engagement “You never know if you’ll fit in the university until you really study here.” That’s what Professor Simons told me, when I attended the Cambridge Academic Development Seminar two years ago. Frankly speaking, I’ve never been to Manchester, and unfortunately, I was a big fan of Chelsea F.C.. But I do know that Manchester is the second-most poplulous urban area. Bingo! Apart from London, this must be the best place for a Business School student. “Why do a business postgraduate program? “ ,asked myself. I believe this is an important question held by the admissions officers as well. I’d say this internship I am doing now, at HTC Vive China Sales Team, firmed my decision. I never thought I would so enjoy working at a high-tech company. Selling my favorite product is what I’d love to do. As you know from my self-introduction, I am a gamer and an Apple fan, so I’m considering working for Blizzard, Apple or back to HTC Vive. With a clear goal and related experience, I’m sure I can persuade Manchester that I’m worth it. Alumni There’s one more thing I’d like to consider, which is after graduation affairs. By thinking of thiese, I can show Manchester that I’m confident enough to get enrolled. And under the guidance of a specific goal, I will make a contribution to this entity. As my supervisor told me on my first day: you need to keep a clear mind about you contirbution before you ask for resources from the organization. Jerry 04.21]]></content>

      <title><![CDATA[The First Step of Hexo]]></title>

      <content type="text"><![CDATA[Hi! Welcome to my official Blog at Hexo!Today, I’ll be trying to apply a postgraduate program in UK.So, you may find the whole record of my Applying Life!And I’ll also post some python related articles~P.S. Really love Markdown.And here comes the first article, a reply on the forum. I do have a new sense about applying a postgraduate program overseas. At the very beginning, I tried so hard digging all the requirements for admission, such as GPA, IELTS, GMAT etc.. And the first two steps(It’s a pity I only got time to finish the first two, due to IELTS test coming up this Sat. and internship work.) enlightened me that there exists something cannot be examined quantitively. My grade is a vital component in my application, but no all.And taking my postgraduate program overseas is not like competing with all the applicants with scoring ability, but to show the school that I AM QUALIFIED. And here goes another question: What is the standard of QUALIFIED? I’m not sure at this very moment, however, I’ll update HERE once the idea bumps up(too many DDLs crowding recently). Why do I have to take postgraduate programs overseas? The answer is obvious: for future career development. It’s a must-do to have a Master degree if you want to go further and get paid better. I’m trying to apply a Marketing related program, mostly because of the internship at HTC Vive. The first day I reported to my director, I got my hands dirty on dealing with orders flying from all over the country. I feel so lucky to have the opportunity to be the member of China Sales Team.One of my strengths is the ability to learn something new, but it also leads to my worst weakness: NEVER DIG DEEP. So how to maximize the utility of this life I got 22 years ago? Dealing with different people on different things by different rules in different fields. That’s something keeps me curious enough to breathe.And Marketing is related to the major, Public Finance, I am studying. They all want to predict the human behavior and take advantage of their prediction(mostly guess). I’m so addicted to this as well.In the last, when I looked back on what I’d done during the two and half years in college, I suddenly found myself winning awards related to BUSINESS(which kept me BUSY). These can be used as supporting materials, of course, to get a better chance get myself admitted. However, aren’t they indicating that’s what I like and am good at? JerryApril.19]]></content>
